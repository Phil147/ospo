 
# Becoming a Maintainer 

1. **Organization Access:**
   - Open GIAM and request approval for "Allianz Open Source" to access the GitHub organization.

2. **Repository Access:**
   - Contact the current project maintainer to identify the second GIAM group necessary for repository access.

Remember to use your personal GitHub account, not the auto-generated EMU (GitHub Enterprise Managed User), identifiable with 
a name pattern like `firstname-lastname_allianz`. EMU accounts are limited to internal development and should not be used for 
open source contributions. Integrate your Allianz email into your GitHub account for proper contribution identification within 
the company context.
