# Linting and Compliance

In order to maintain a standardized process across our repositories, the following settings and resources are mandatory:

1. Repository Description: A clear and concise description of the repository's purpose and contents. ([How-to Set]())

2. Repository Topics (Labels): Appropriate labels to categorize and manage issues effectively. ([How-to Set]())

3. License File: A valid license file outlining the terms and conditions for repository use. ([How-to Add]())

4. Readme: A comprehensive readme file providing essential information about the project, its setup, and usage. ([How-to Create]())

5. Maintainer File: A file specifying maintainers, with the recommendation to include work email addresses for direct contact. ([How-to Set Up]())

6. Contributing File: A guide for contributors explaining how to contribute to the project. ([How-to Create]())

To ensure these requirements are met and consistently maintained, the repolinter tool is regularly executed, automatically creating issues for any deviations from the specified standards.
