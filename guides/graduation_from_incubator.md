# Graduation from Incubator

## Purpose of Incubator
The Incubator at Allianz serves as a space for early-stage projects, where incomplete functionality, documentation, or missing processes are deliberately overlooked as part of the setup process.

## Graduation Readiness Checks
If you believe your project is ready for prime time, please check the following key criteria:

1. MVP Functionality Ready: Confirm that the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality is fully developed and operational.

2. Documentation Availability: Ensure comprehensive and accessible documentation is available for the project.

3. Following Open Source Best Practices: Validate that the project adheres to open source best practices and standards.

## Initiate the Graduation Process
To kickstart the graduation process, either create a pull request on the configuration file or raise an issue.
