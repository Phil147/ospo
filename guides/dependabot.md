# Dependabot 

Dependabot is a security feature for managing dependencies, ensuring your software projects stay up-to-date with the latest libraries and packages. This automated process is enabled by default and scans dependency files like `package.json` or `pom.xml` to detect outdated libraries, generating pull requests with proposed updates.

As your project evolves, you may want to customize Dependabot's behavior. For more details on customizing Dependabot, you can refer to the official [documentation](https://docs.github.com/de/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file).
